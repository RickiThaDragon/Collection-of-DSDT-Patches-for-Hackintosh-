I just wanted to say that I am in process of getting some example files typed out and finished and proof read by myself so that they can be as error free as possible. 
The files are not Universal but will work for many and will work for the system descibed in the files of my own Which are 100 Series SKYLAKE i7 6700T LENOVO M700 TC-FW
and also a 300 Series COFFEE LAKE 8th Generation Intel UHD Graphics 630 - DELL Optiplex 3060 MFF
Aside from this the information can be used to structure your own files and be used as a reference to expand upon and contribute back to the community of Hackintosh 
Users that the files may be of use to. 
I do not accept nor will I ever ask for any Donations whatsoever. I am not here to profit financially and im not here to hustle anyone. 
I wanted to have a place where one can reference files at anytime and use them for their own needs and if they want to contribute back what has helped them or have
any valuable insight or information they want to share then feel free to do so. 


Finally---------UPFRONT I SAY THIS BECAUSE FOR THOSE WHO WILL COME HERE AND BE OFFENDED BY "OH HE USING dsdt and Dortania say this or tonymac say this" FOR
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN THAT FRAME OF MIND OR HAVE THAT MINDSET THEN THIS IS WHAT I AM SAYING TO YOU--------"I DO NOT CARE ABOUT SUCH TRIVIAL THINGS" IF YOU USE JUST SSDT 
THEN THATS GREAT BECAUSE IT IS WORKING FOR YOU, AND IF YOU USE DSDT THEN THAT IS GREAT BECAUSE IT IS WORKING FOR YOU. POINT IS THAT EVERYONES HARDWARE AND SITUATION IS 
DIFFERENT AND WHAT WILL WORK FOR SOME WONT WORK FOR EVERYONE. FOR I HAVE HEARD MY EARFULL OF THIS NONNSENSE ABOUT YOU CANT OR SHOULD NOT EDIT DSDT ANYYMORE IT HAS BECOME OBSELETE WITH SSDT 
AND SO ON.  WHILE IT MIGHT BE EASIER FOR SOME AND BETTER SUITED FOR THERE SITUATION (MAINLY NEWBEES) IT WILL NOT BE THAT WAY FOR EVERYONE. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANYONE "SUPERIOR" BECAUSE 
THEY ARE USING "SSDT BECAUSE DORTANIA SAID TOO ATTITUDE AND NOT DSDT"  ILL STATE IT CLEARLY HERE I DONT CARE ABOUT AGAIN SUCH TRIVIAL THINGS I DONT CARE WHAT DORTANIA SAID OR
FU.... TONYMAC OR FU.... ANYONE ELSE. WHEN THEY SAY DSDT IS OBSELETE BECAUSE OF SSDT THAT IS NONSENSE AND IT IS NOT TRUE!! IM NOT GOING TO DEBATE THAT OR ARGUE THAT WITH ANYONE
IT IS A PREFERENCE ONLY ON WHAT IS BEST FOR ONES SAID SITUATION. AND I HAVE RESPECT FOR BOTH AND MOST CERTAINLY USE BOTH AS NEEDED FOR MY THINGS. 



THE ONLY REASON I WENT INTO ALL THAT IS BECAUSE IF THAT ARISES FROM ANYONE IVE ALREADY ADDRESSED IT HERE AND STATED HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT, THAT IM NOT GOING TO 
ARGUE IT. IT IS A WASTE OF TOPIC TO ARGUE ABOUT & NOTHING GOOD BUT HATE & OPPOSITION & ANIMOSITY ARE DERIVED FROM IT. I WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE MY LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE
AND AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH PEOPLE OVER SOMETHING THEY HAVE READ SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT SOMEONE ELSE SAID AT SO AND SO TIME BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES ARE REPEATING PROBALY
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE SAID SOMETIME AGO AND THE CHAIN CONTINUES. TO HELL WITH THAT. IT IS A OBSTRUCTION AND A BARRIER TO LEARNING ANYTHING NEW,IT IS FUELED PRIMARILY BY 
A SELECT HOST OF "HATERS" THAT SHOULD PROBALY NOT BE DOING HACKINTOSH TO BEGIN WITH SINCE ITS CAUSING SUCH STRIFE THAT THEY MUST INFECT OTHER LIVES WITH THEIR NEGATIVE 
NONSENSE


SO WITH THAT SAID, DONT COME AT ME WITH THOSE THINGS BCUZ HERE IS THE "README" FILE THAT IS ADDRESSING IT ABOVE


SO ANYONE AND EVERYONE FEEL FREE TO OFFER INPUT KNOWLEDGE INSIGHT ETC, EXAMPLES AND ALL OF IT. CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICSM OR HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK BETTER
OR HOW YOU GET CERTAIN HARDWARE TO FUNCTION WHERE OTHERS HAVE NOT SUCCEDDED. And naturally of course there is no files yet but as I said there will be as Im diligently 
woprking on that right now and hopefully wil have plenty of that ready in just a few days or so as time permits. 



Just wanted to post a update so that anyone in passing hereiis made aware that its a wwork in progess and will be up and running very soon hopefully.
                                      THANK YOU for reading if you made it this far and have a great rest of the day or night whatever applies
